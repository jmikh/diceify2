# Placeholder for Mona Lisa Image

To use the Mona Lisa image in the demo:

1. Save your Mona Lisa image as `demo-portrait.jpg` in this public folder
2. The demo will automatically use it

The image should be approximately 400x500 pixels for best results.

For now, the demo is using an SVG placeholder that simulates a portrait.
